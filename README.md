# Don Kittle Coding Assignment

Hi, and welcome to my submission.

I'll say that it's been quite a number of years since doing Java; I moved to Scala and then to Kotlin in search of a JVM language with more functional features.
That said, here is an overview of what I've done.

## Building and Running Tests

The project is built and dependencies managed using Gradle. Build and test the project using:

`./gradlew build`

I created a breakdown of the minimal requirements for the assignment in [Coding Assignment](docs/Assignment.md).

I created an overview of what I believed the domain model definitions should/could be along with an articulation of the use-cases that need to be supported in [Application Design Overview](docs/Application%20Design%20Overview.md)

There are some class diagrams of the main entities of the domain model [Entities](docs/Entities.md). It includes an inheritance class diagram for Appointments and the 3 different types of them, though that seemed like that wasn't needed for an intial solution.

Finally, I have quite a few thoughts on the design and implementation, including some next steps in the [Design and Implementation Thoughts](docs/Design%20and%20Implementation%20Thoughts.md) document.
